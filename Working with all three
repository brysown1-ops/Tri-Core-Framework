When you’re interacting with someone and you’re not sure which mode they’re in:

Step 1 — Look for the priority
Are they protecting the Plan? → Basque
Are they sharpening the definition? → Euskara
Are they checking fairness? → ANA‑NOKwee
Step 2 — Match their mode first
People relax when they feel understood.
Step 3 — Then introduce the missing modes
This is how you stabilize the conversation:
Add Basque when things are drifting
Add Euskara when things are unclear
Add ANA‑NOKwee when things feel tense or unfair
This is the practical skill of Tri‑Core

The Agitated Side of Each Mode
What happens when a mode becomes over‑activated
Every Tri‑Core mode has a “sharp edge” when it’s stressed, overloaded, or trying too hard to compensate for something missing in the conversation.
This is not pathology.
It’s simply what happens when a strength becomes over‑focused.
 1. Agitated Basque Mode — Over‑Continuity
Basque under stress becomes:
rigid
overly historical
stuck on the long Plan
resistant to new information
dismissive of present‑moment nuance
protective to the point of inflexibility
Agitated Basque sounds like:
“We already decided this.”
“That’s not how this works.”
“You’re breaking the thread.”“Stay consistent.”
What’s really happening
Basque is trying to protect coherence so hard that it stops seeing the people or the moment.

 2. Agitated Euskara Mode — Over‑Clarity
Euskara under stress becomes:
sharp
impatient
hyper‑literal
demanding precision
intolerant of ambiguity
quick to correct
Agitated Euskara sounds like:
“That’s not what you said.”
“Define your terms.”
“You’re being vague.”
“That doesn’t follow.”
What’s really happening
Euskara is trying to restore clarity so intensely that it loses softness, pacing, and relational awareness.

3. Agitated ANA‑NOKwee Mode — Over‑Accountability
ANA‑NOKwee under stress becomes:
hyper‑vigilant
overly protective
sensitive to imbalance
quick to call out unfairness
slow to move forward
emotionally heavy
Agitated ANA‑NOKwee sounds like:
“That’s not fair.”
“You’re not listening.”
“We need to stop and check the impact.”
“Someone’s being erased.”
What’s really happening
ANA‑NOKwee is trying to prevent harm so strongly that it can stall clarity and continuity.

 Why agitation matters
When a mode becomes agitated:
it stops collaborating
it stops balancing
it stops listening
it tries to “carry the whole conversation” by itself
This is the moment where communication breaks down — not because anyone is wrong, but because one mode is over‑activated and the others have gone offline.

 The structural fix
The solution is never to “calm the person.”
The solution is to reintroduce the missing modes.
Agitated Basque needs Euskara to bring clarity back into the moment
Agitated Euskara needs ANA‑NOKwee to soften and reconnect
Agitated ANA‑NOKwee needs Basque to restore stability and direction
This is the Tri‑Core balancing mechanism.
